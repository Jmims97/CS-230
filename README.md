Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  -
  - The Gaming Room wanted to develop a web-based software application named "Draw It or Lose It," a Pictionary-style game.
  -  They aimed to expand this game across various computing environments, including macOS, Windows, Linux, and mobile platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - 
  - Provided detailed recommendations for the operating platform, storage, memory management, distributed systems, and security measures tailored to macOS.   
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  -
  - Working through a design document helped in organizing thoughts and requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -
  - I would choose to revise the security measures section. I would expand on the specific implementation details of security protocols, such as providing more examples of encryption standards.
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -
  - I closely reviewed the client’s requirements and translated them into technical specifications. Which meant using the proper programming environments for the job
  - Considering the user’s needs is crucial as it ensures the software meets the intended use case, providing value and enhancing user satisfaction.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  -
  - I employed a user-centric approach, focusing on the client’s requirements and how the software would be utilized. This involved iterative design, where feedback was continuously incorporated in the design.
  - Use Agile methodologies to continuously iterate on the design and implementation, allowing for flexibility and adjustments based on feedback.
